Hello guy. Well come to my video tutorial.  
In this tutorial i will make simple esp for pubg mobile gameloop  
I will not show how how can you by pass anti cheat system. just will show how can you make esp and read virtual memory with C++  
And i will show how can you create overlay, and other what you need for esp. but i will not use directx or opengl native. I will use sfml library on c++

Its my first video tutorial on youtube. Ä°ts little hard for me. Also i have not english language. Forgive me if I have a mistake while talking. Then i will move step by step videos. 

Whats my steps.  
1 Create Project  
3 Create overlay on game screen for draw some things.  
2 Create process manager for find android emulater process id  
4 Memory manager: I will use driver for read momory. In this tutorial i will use kpreccess driver with bypaph  
5 Create esp for scan game entity list and other entity details.  
6 Create entity object  
7 ini file reader for settings and enetity informations.

But i will not do code about aim hacking. Esp only.   
I will use VStudio 2017. Because i will use SFML libray for draw esp. And SFML library support VStudio 2017.
